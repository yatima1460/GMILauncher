    LIESPIRE is a Memory-style card game for two players.
Each card has a height value. Choose wisely.
The goal of the players is to build a tower of cards taller than their opponent’s. Or at least, make him believe so.

At the beginning of the game, each player receives a DECEPTION card with an additional rule to win the game.

The possible deception cards are:
PROLIFERATION: if you collect all the mouse cards in your tower, you get a +3 height bonus;
SMALL BARREL: you win if you have the lowest tower;
SPIRITUAL SESSION: ghosts are worth 1 in height;
TREAT: no deception for you this game.

Remember. Deceive. Win.
